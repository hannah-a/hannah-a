### Hi there 👋

### Hi I'm Hannah Armstrong (Also known as Hans like the guy from Frozen )

I started learning Website Developement because I only wanted to do welding for the art and not as a career. I quickly fell in love with the mixture between art and logic, creating something that looks good and making it functional. I should have known that this would be a good career path for me when I made my first portfolio website for my art using Weebly at 13. 

Currently I'm working on going to school so many of my projects revolve around my classes and assignments. It is very often that I get to create projects that I am interested and also give me an A! My degree has given me a **deep passion** for this field and a desire to delve deeper into Computer Science than I ever thought I would. 

In my spare time, I have a multitude of hobbies that I will probably never turn into side hustles. Such as drawing, painting, playing harp (I may get certified to be a Musical Therapist and play for the elderly and dying), along with alot of outdoor hobbies like rock climbing and swimming.

I hope to work at a company that is leading the way in design and development along with making a real difference in the world. It was very hard for me to pick a career, but once I realized that my true goal was to be around smart, creative and innovative people, this field fits all those requirements. 

Thank you for reading! 😸
